# Sentiment analysis of show reviews

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Get hands-on experience with packages and tools for analyzing texts (`natasha`, `nltk`, `spacy`, `rnnmorph`, `pymorphy2`)
- Investigate available pretrained models (`wor2vec`, `fasttext`, `navec`, models from sber, deeppavlov and others)
- Learn how to fine-tune `BERT`-like models for classification tasks

## [Baseline: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression](https://nbviewer.org/github/Extremesarova/shows_analysis/blob/main/shows_analysis/notebooks/4_sentiment_analysis/01_baseline.ipynb)

As a baseline, I've decided to choose a simple combination of TF-IDF for text vectorization and Logistic Regression for classification.  

The micro F1 score is `0.795` for baseline. I think that it is a very strong baseline.
